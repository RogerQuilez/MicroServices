Schabell</name></author><id>http://www.schabell.org/2021/12/2021-year-in-review.html</id><updated>2021-12-31T06:00:00Z</updated><content type="html">The year 2021 is coming to a close, ending pretty much the same way here in the Netherlands as it started in 2020... a lockdown. Empty streets, closed shops, closed restaurants, no parties, no gatherings, and all just when we thought it might be getting back to normal. Not yet. Meanwhile work has gone one and life has continued for me with little change other than the occasional possibility to get out and about to visit you. Just like in 2020, we've shared more time together this year online in virtual events, coffee breaks, and other strange virtual events. On the up side there were the possibilities to travel again in 2021 and I got to spend time with my family back in the US for the first time in over three years! This year I spent all my time generating architecture content, upgrading demos, updating workshops, and spreading as much good cheer as I could from behind my webcam. I was able to visit a few customers in the Netherlands and even get out and about for an overseas event in Ireland, but I'll get to that in a bit. It was my +12th year at Red Hat and the worldwide pandemic continued to influence our daily lives as it surged and subsided throughout the year. While it's a constant in all the planning and activities, let's review some of the activities from 2021 that were not affected by the pandemic. PUBLISHING Again this year I've been publishing a lot online, maybe even more so now that the events are all virtual  and I needed to float new ideas for your review. This year I've published  on this site, many were , and multiple articles featured elsewhere on external sites.  I also did a few special writing projects, such as the . My hobby of writing as  continued, but slowed considerably due to the shortened season and my time being used up elsewhere. It's been amazing to share these insights and experiences that can make others better at what they do. It's the most rewarding part of working in open source, the sharing, mentoring, and collaboration that makes all around you grow. Speaking engagements were numerous, but mostly virtual until the in person event in Ireland (see travel below). One of the more fun ones was a workshop I delivered during my vacation from a hotel on an island in Greece, always a challenge! There were too many speaking engagements to list here so just sending you over to my for the listing and content made available from my sessions there. Here are some of the feedback that was shared throughout the year: “Was in a class last week, about becoming a manager. And they asked a question about who inspire you the most as a leader, guess who came to my mind first &#x1f61b;. You &#x1f600;. I think a true leader leads by example. And just want you should know how much you inspired me.” “Pleasure having you around. A good man with a good heart.” “Thanks Eric, you are an amazing person and someone I always enjoyed working with." “Many thanks for all your help Eric and for all the top material you create, it is absolutely helpful and a big asset to spread the word of what we at Red Hat can do. Really enjoy working with you, man!” “Do we have a UI for Eric's brain? Like, I can just type in a TLA and get a printout?” “DZone Community Member of the Day: Eric D. Schabell. Long-time DZone contributor he’s  posted over 300 articles on DZone that have generated over 2.1 million page views.” “Well done Eric! Amazing to see how much you have contributed back to the community by sharing your knowledge”  “Such a fun session! Took a ton of notes to better understand the environment and opportunities available for hybrid cloud and digital transformation. Should take the band on the road guys!”“Well done Eric! Amazing to see how much you have contributed back to the community by sharing your knowledge”  “Thanks Eric, this is really useful to learn the main features of PAM.!”  “You’re leaders in this space (Portfolio Architecture), this is just awesome content!” CODING AND OTHER CONTENT This year saw the  complete its sixth year since the first commit on April 1, 2016 and is hosted on Gitlab. This year it continued to expand beyond the projects illustrating containers, cloud operations, deployments, AppDev in the Cloud to include more portfolio architecture workshops and example repositories. Be sure to jump on over there and watch the updates as container based projects are migrating to OpenShift Container Platform 4.x and beyond. Almost all of my workshops and demo projects have been updated and are based on installing using OpenShift through the CodeReady Containers offering or just native containers with : * : * * * * * : * * * These workshops are all constantly undergoing revisions and updates to add new product innovations so be sure to check them out thorough next year. The biggest work I've delivered on this year can be found in the  repository where I've added 12 new architecture projects ranging from cloud adoption, remote server management, retail, and healthcare projects. This is just the public facing content, there is more but that's targeting enablement of the internal field teams at Red Hat. TRAVEL This year the travel was a bit better than 2020, but not by much. Several lockdowns hampered travel for most of us, but here's the overview. Just for reference, back in 2019 a normal travel year was over 138,000 km, 22 cities, and 9 countries. In 2021 it was just five trips covering 22,914km, 8 cities, and 4 countries.  Four of those trips were personal vacations, so only one trip was made for work:  * Dublin, Ireland (work) One can only hope we are meeting even more face to face soon in 2022 and I'm seeding conferences with sessions throughout the coming year to be ready when it happens. TIME FOR OTHER PROJECTS The positive side of this lack of travel is that I've worked on a lot of physical projects around my home again in 2021. I'm a type of person that likes to fix stuff that breaks down himself, so I have turned my attentions to maintenance and improvements for my home along with some professional builders for the bigger projects: * painted three more interior doors and all their door frames * remodelled two bathrooms * remodelled fireplace * replaced four external windows and repainted frames * started playing with mobile development around react-native As long as the travel is not taking up all my time I'll plan to continue with the maintenance work in 2022. THANKS TO YOU ALL Here is hoping you enjoyed what I was able to bring to you in 2021. I'm sharing, entertaining, and hopefully slipping in a bit of educational content for your daily lives. I want to thank you personally for attending any of the webinars, virtual conference sessions, online workshops, and for taking the time to read my published articles. As 2022 kicks off, there's hope for travel and in person events, but using the mediums we have at our disposal we'll continue to explore the amazing things you can achieve with open technologies. Finally, stay safe, take care of yours, and hope to see you soon face to face!</content><dc:creator>Eric D.

Some of the best developers in the world work for Red Hat, and we're fortunate that many of them contribute to Red Hat Developer. We think this year's top 10 articles showcase the breadth of our contributors' interests and expertise, as well as that of our readers. Without further ado, here are Red Hat Developer's most popular articles of 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;1. How to activate your no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Following the January 2020 announcement of Red Hat's new &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/rhel/download"&gt;no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) subscription&lt;/a&gt;, this article walks you through everything you need to set up a subscription in three easy steps. No wonder &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/author/miroslav-suchy"&gt;Miroslav Suchý&lt;/a&gt;'s &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/10/how-to-activate-your-no-cost-red-hat-enterprise-linux-subscription"&gt;How to activate your no-cost Red Hat Enterprise Linux subscription&lt;/a&gt; was our most-read article in 2021!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;2. Distributed transaction patterns for microservices compared&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/authors/bilgin-ibryam"&gt;Bilgin Ibryam&lt;/a&gt; is co-author of the &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/books/kubernetes-patterns"&gt;Kubernetes Patterns&lt;/a&gt; e-book and a frequent contributor, with over a dozen articles published on Red Hat Developer to date. In &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/21/distributed-transaction-patterns-microservices-compared"&gt;Distributed transaction patterns for microservices compared&lt;/a&gt;, he discusses the benefits and drawbacks of five distributed transaction patterns and addresses one of the pain points of modernizing monolithic applications into &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/microservices"&gt;microservices&lt;/a&gt;. We expect readers will seek out this article for years to come.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;3. Application modernization patterns with Apache Kafka, Debezium, and Kubernetes&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Another article in Bilgin's series tackling the challenges of modernizing legacy applications, this one offers both a well-tested pattern (Strangler, used in tandem with Outbox, Sidecar, and Saga) and standardized tools for implementing it. &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/06/14/application-modernization-patterns-apache-kafka-debezium-and-kubernetes"&gt;Application modernization patterns with Apache Kafka, Debezium, and Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; is a must-read for developers interested in using &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kubernetes"&gt;Kubernetes&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kafka-kubernetes"&gt;Apache Kafka&lt;/a&gt; to create robust systems that evolve over time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;4. Making environment variables accessible in front-end containers&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We published many articles in 2021 about developing and deploying applications in &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/containers"&gt;containers&lt;/a&gt;, but this one stood out for its focus on building containers for single-page &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/javascript"&gt;JavaScript&lt;/a&gt; applications. As author &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/authors/joel-lord"&gt;Joel Lord&lt;/a&gt; explains, the application's configuration settings will be different depending on where the container runs, and the challenge is how to make those settings accessible in any environment. &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/04/making-environment-variables-accessible-in-front-end-containers"&gt;Making environment variables accessible in front-end containers&lt;/a&gt; leaves you with a solution that you can reuse for any of your future JavaScript projects.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;5. C# 9 top-level programs and target-typed expressions&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Red Hatter and .NET Core developer &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/author/tom-deseyn"&gt;Tom Deseyn&lt;/a&gt;'s C# 9 language features series was our most popular series this year. This article, &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/03/30/c-9-top-level-programs-and-target-typed-expressions"&gt;C# 9 top-level programs and target-typed expressions&lt;/a&gt;, started it all.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;6. C# 9 pattern matching&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The second article in the C# 9 series, &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/04/06/c-9-pattern-matching"&gt;C# 9 pattern matching&lt;/a&gt; introduces changes to pattern matching in C# 9, including updates and support for combining, inverting, and nesting patterns. A breezy read with many code samples for developers adopting C# 9.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;7. Why should I choose Quarkus over Spring for my microservices?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/quarkus"&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt; is one of our most popular topics on Red Hat Developer, and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/08/31/why-should-i-choose-quarkus-over-spring-my-microservices"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Quarkus and Spring Boot developer &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/author/eric-deandrea"&gt;Eric Deandrea&lt;/a&gt; helps to explain why. Find out why many Spring developers are switching to Quarkus and how to get started using the Kubernetes-native Java platform for your microservices.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p class="Indent1"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note:&lt;/strong&gt; If you're ready to make the leap from Spring to Quarkus, see Eric's e-book, &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/e-books/quarkus-spring-developers"&gt;Quarkus for Spring Developers&lt;/a&gt;, published by Red Hat Developer in August 2021.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;8. Shenandoah in OpenJDK 17: Sub-millisecond GC pauses&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The Shenandoah OpenJDK garbage collection project was created to reduce garbage collection pause times, and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/09/16/shenandoah-openjdk-17-sub-millisecond-gc-pauses"&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; concludes a series explaining how the Shenandoah team did it. Shenandoah GC Project Lead &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/author/roman-kennke"&gt;Roman Kennke&lt;/a&gt; opens with a retrospective of pause time improvements from JDK 12 through 16, then describes how introducing concurrent thread stack processing solved the remaining garbage collection pause-time challenge in JDK 17.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;9. Deploy Helm charts with Jenkins CI/CD in Red Hat OpenShift 4&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/05/24/deploy-helm-charts-jenkins-cicd-red-hat-openshift-4"&gt;quick read&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/author/shailendra-kumar-singh"&gt;Shailendra Kumar Singh&lt;/a&gt; gets you started with Helm and Jenkins CI/CD in a step-by-step tutorial. Start with an overview of the Helm package manager for Kubernetes, then create and deploy your first Helm chart and use it to deploy an application using Jenkins CI/CD and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/openshift"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift.&lt;/a&gt; A simple, practical introduction written for beginners.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;10. How to work around Docker's new download rate limit on OpenShift&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2021/02/18/how-to-work-around-dockers-new-download-rate-limit-on-red-hat-openshift"&gt;This article&lt;/a&gt;, a response to Docker's new download rate limits for anonymous users, introduced in November 2020, explains how to get around the unwanted &lt;code&gt;toomanyrequests&lt;/code&gt; error without upgrading to a paid Docker account. Note that this hack, presented by &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/authors/joel-lord"&gt;Joel Lord&lt;/a&gt;, is specifically for developers experimenting with a free OpenShift cluster in the &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox"&gt;Developer Sandbox for Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;We hope you've enjoyed this recap of Red Hat Developer's 10 most read articles and tutorials published in 2021. During the past year, we've had the pleasure of publishing hundreds of technical articles and other resources (such as &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/cheat-sheets"&gt;cheat sheets&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/learn"&gt;interactive courses&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/developer-sandbox/get-started"&gt;Developer Sandbox activities&lt;/a&gt;) written by developers working at Red Hat.

Schabell</name></author><id>http://www.schabell.org/2021/12/installing-fedora-35-on-macbook-pro-13-inch-late-2011.html</id><updated>2021-12-27T06:00:00Z</updated><content type="html">This weekend I decided to update my old Macbook Pro 13 inch from late 2011, with 125GB SSD and 8GB RAM. It's a machine I've taken on trips around the world and back in the day ran many a session, workshop, or demo on sharing all that AppDev goodness you know from JBoss technologies. Last time we checked, this was , so how about an update to Fedora 35? Below the steps and adjustments needed to  working on this laptops in under an hour. GET FEDORA 35 The first step is to find the right way to install Fedora on this laptop. It does have a CD slot so I guess one could opt for burning an ISO to boot from, but I chose to go straight to a bootable USB option. I got on my other Macbook and visited the  where you find a link to Fedora Media Writer. Just click on the icon (in my case, the apple) for your machine type and you get an installation package.  Install this and start it to see the GUI that guides you through the process. Select the Fedora Workstation 35 option: Next you can select the top right button to Create Live USB option: Then you'll see the image start to download and the drop down menu for selecting where to install the image. If you now plug in an USB stick with the right size available, you can select and install the image directly onto the USB device: Once finished just close this GUI and remove the USB stick.  INSTALLING ON MACBOOK PRO 13 INCH (LATE 2014) Insert the USB stick you created above, there is a port on the left side for this, (re-)start your Macbook Pro and be sure to hold down the Option (or alt) key, just to the left of the CMD key. This opens a menu of options to start this machine from and we'll need to use the EFI option as that's our USB image. Now it's booting from the device and you just can follow the . It really helps if you have a network cable connection you can plug your Macbook Pro into as the wifi device (broadcom) does not work out of the box.  You should get the chance to install to hard drive and put it on your machine permanently. Once you've completed the installer, reboot your machine and you should see Fedora 33 as the option to boot from and end up in your new machine. Now the only thing missing is a wifi driver so there are a few things to be done that require that network cable to be connected as we install the development packages for the kernel we are running and then build the broadcom-wl driver for that kernel. Let's verify the actual card we need for wifi in a terminal: $ lspci -vnn -d 14e4: The output will be several items, one of which should be listing something like: Network controller [0280]: Broadcom Inc. and subsidiaries.... Subsystem: Apple Inc. AirPort Extreme... We now need to install a repository to pull the broadcom stuff as follows: $ su -c 'dnf install -y http://download1.rpmfusion.org/free/fedora/rpmfusion-free-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm' And then the non-free repository: $ su -c 'dnf install -y http://download1.rpmfusion.org/nonfree/fedora/rpmfusion-nonfree-release-$(rpm -E %fedora).noarch.rpm' The next part is interesting as you look at the running kernel you'll see v5.15.11-200.fc35 but we are going to be using the development kernel packages to build our broadcom wireless driver so you need to install the v5.14.10-300.fc35 (available at the time of this writing). You can check these using 'uname -r' and list the installed kernel packages using 'sudo dnf list kernel': $ sudo dnf list kernel kernel.x86_64                     5.14.10-300.fc35 kernel.x86_64                     5.15.11-200.fc35 Install the development packages with the following: $ sudo dnf install -y akmods kernel-devel-5.14.10-300.fc35 You'll see a lot of packages scroll by and then the development kernel package install: Now install the Broadcom Wireless package: $ sudo dnf install -y broadcom-wl Now build the kernel module: $ sudo akmods Checking mods exist for 5.15.11-200.fc35.x86_64     [OK] Now reboot your machine and you should be able to view the wireless driver (wl) with the following: $ lsmod | grep wl Now setup your wireless connection in Fedora: Pretty straight forward if you were following along the last time, so hope you enjoyed this end of the year update to the latest Fedora on your old Macbook Pro 13 inch from late 2011! &gt; Starting to look at upgrading my macbook from 2011 by installing 35 on it. &gt; Crossing fingers that the wifi card works without manual intervention. Will be &gt; reporting back soon with the results. Here's the overview of the steps from &gt; last time: &gt; &gt; — Eric D. Schabell (@ericschabell)</content><dc:creator>Eric D.

As a comprehensive environment built on top of &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/openshift"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt;, OpenShift Data Science integrates Jupyter notebooks—the core IDE where data scientists train models—with model development frameworks such as TensorFlow and PyTorch.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can think of OpenShift Data Science as a meta-operator that sits above other &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/kubernetes/operators"&gt;Kubernetes Operators&lt;/a&gt; and combines them into a coherent, integrated environment. Currently, OpenShift Data Science partner technologies include:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;Anaconda Commercial Edition for secure distribution and package management&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;IBM Watson Studio for building and managing models at scale and for AutoML&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Intel OpenVINO and oneAPI AI analytics toolkits for optimizing and tuning models&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Seldon Deploy for deploying, managing, and monitoring models&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Starburst Galaxy for data integration&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;Support for NVIDIA accelerated computing is coming very soon!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Where can I learn more?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Visit the &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/red-hat-openshift-data-science"&gt;OpenShift Data Science&lt;/a&gt; landing page to learn more about how data scientists, data engineers, and application developers use this service to collaborate across the intelligent application life cycle.&lt;/p&gt; The post &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/12/23/more-machine-learning-openshift-data-science" title="More machine learning with OpenShift Data Science"&gt;More machine learning with OpenShift Data Science&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog" title="Red Hat Developer"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary><dc:creator>Audrey Reznik</dc:creator><dc:date>2021-12-23T07:00:00Z</dc:date></entry><entry><title type="html">How to run WildFly on Openshift</title><link rel="alternate" href="http://www.mastertheboss.com/soa-cloud/openshift/using-wildfly-on-openshift/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=using-wildfly-on-openshift" /><author><name>F.Marchioni</name></author><id>http://www.mastertheboss.com/soa-cloud/openshift/using-wildfly-on-openshift/?utm_source=rss&amp;utm_medium=rss&amp;utm_campaign=using-wildfly-on-openshift</id><updated>2021-12-23T01:38:00Z</updated><content type="html">This tutorial will teach you how to run the latest version of WildFly on Openshift.

In most situations the newly created user is the equivalent of a self-registered user, and does not have the ability to receive any additional roles or groups. However, there are some vectors that are harder to reproduce, but may result in additional privileges. We highly recommend everyone upgrade to Keycloak 15.1.1 or 16.1.0 as soon as possible. Keycloak 16.0.0 also includes the fix, but if you are not already running this version we recommend going straight to 16.1.0. If you are unable to upgrade we recommend mitigate the issue by blocking access to the user creation REST endpoint in the interim. This can be achieved with the following CLI commands: bin/jboss-cli.sh --connect /subsystem=undertow/configuration=filter/expression-filter=keycloakPathOverrideUsersCreateEndpoint:add( \ expression="(regex('^/auth/admin/realms/(.*)/users$') and method(POST))-&gt; response-code(400)" \ ) /subsystem=undertow/server=default-server/host=default-host/filter-ref=keycloakPathOverrideUsersCreateEndpoint:add() This will block both valid and invalid attempts at creating new users, including requests from the Keycloak admin console. Alternatively, the path /auth/admin/realms/.*/users and method POST, or /auth/admin completely, can be blocked with a firewall.

While discovering a service isn't much of an issue if you employ a well-known set of conventions, getting the credentials and other details required to access that service is sometimes trickier.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://svc-cat.io"&gt;Kubernetes Service Catalog&lt;/a&gt; was an attempt to simplify provisioning and binding to services, but it seems to have lost momentum. The lack of uniformity between providers, differences in how each service communicates binding information, and the fact that developers tend to favor operators for provisioning services all made the Service Catalog hard to use in practice.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-developer/service-binding-operator"&gt;Service Binding Operator&lt;/a&gt; for Kubernetes and &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/openshift"&gt;Red Hat OpenShift&lt;/a&gt; is a more recent initiative. It stays out of the way of service provisioning, leaving that to operators. Instead, it focuses on how to best communicate binding information to the application. An interesting part of the specification is the &lt;a href="https://github.com/servicebinding/spec#workload-projection"&gt;workload projection&lt;/a&gt;, which defines a directory structure that will be mounted to the application container when binding occurs in order to pass all the required binding information: type, URI, and credentials&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Other parts of the specification are related to the &lt;code&gt;ServiceBinding&lt;/code&gt; resource, which controls which services are bound to which application, and how.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/products/quarkus/overview"&gt;Quarkus&lt;/a&gt;, which already supports the workload-projection part of the Service Binding specification, recently received enhancements for service binding. In this article, you'll learn how to automatically generate a &lt;code&gt;ServiceBinding&lt;/code&gt; resource, then go through the whole process from installing operators to configuring and deploying an application.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A note about the example&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the example, you will use &lt;a href="https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/"&gt;kind&lt;/a&gt; to install the Service Binding Operator and the &lt;a href="https://github.com/CrunchyData/postgres-operator"&gt;Postgres Operator from Crunchy Data&lt;/a&gt;. After that, you will create a PostgreSQL cluster, and finally create a simple todo application, deploying it and binding it to the provisioned cluster. Before you begin, you may want to take a look at the &lt;a href="https://redhat-developer.github.io/service-binding-operator/userguide/getting-started/quick-start.html"&gt;Service Binding Operator Quick Start Guide&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Set up your clusters&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Begin by creating a new cluster with &lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt;. (If you've already created one, or don't use &lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt; at all, you can skip this step.)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kind create cluster&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;You'll install both of the operators used in our example through the &lt;a href="https://operatorhub.io"&gt;OperatorHub&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Install the Operator Lifecycle Manager&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;The first step is to install the &lt;a href="https://olm.operatorframework.io/"&gt;Operator Lifecycle Manager&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;curl -sL https://github.com/operator-framework/operator-lifecycle-manager/releases/download/v0.19.1/install.sh | bash -s v0.19.1 &lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Install the Service Binding Operator&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, you'll install the Service Binding Operator:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/service-binding-operator.yaml&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before moving to the next step, verify the installation with the following command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl get csv -n operators -w&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;phase&lt;/code&gt; of the Service Binding Operator is &lt;code&gt;Succeeded&lt;/code&gt;, you can proceed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h3&gt;Install the Postgres Operator&lt;/h3&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use the following command to install the Postgres Operator from Crunchy Data:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/postgresql.yaml &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;As you did before, you'll want to verify the installation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl get csv -n operators -w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;phase&lt;/code&gt; of the operator is &lt;code&gt;Succeeded&lt;/code&gt;, you can move to the next stage.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Create a PostgreSQL cluster&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;To begin this process, create a new namespace where you'll install your cluster and application:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl create ns demo kubectl config set-context --current --namespace=demo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;To create the cluster, you need to apply the following custom resource:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code&gt; apiVersion: postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1 kind: PostgresCluster metadata: name: pg-cluster namespace: demo spec: image: registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata/crunchy-postgres-ha:centos8-13.4-0 postgresVersion: 13 instances: - name: instance1 dataVolumeClaimSpec: accessModes: - "ReadWriteOnce" resources: requests: storage: 1Gi backups: pgbackrest: image: registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata/crunchy-pgbackrest:centos8-2.33-2 repos: - name: repo1 volume: volumeClaimSpec: accessModes: - "ReadWriteOnce" resources: requests: storage: 1Gi - name: repo2 volume: volumeClaimSpec: accessModes: - "ReadWriteOnce" resources: requests: storage: 1Gi proxy: pgBouncer: image: registry.developers.crunchydata.com/crunchydata/crunchy-pgbouncer:centos8-1.15-2 &lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;This resource has been borrowed from the &lt;em&gt;Service Binding Operator Quick Start Guide&lt;/em&gt;. Save that file as &lt;code&gt;pg-cluster.yml&lt;/code&gt; and apply it using &lt;code&gt;kubectl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl apply -f ~/pg-cluster.yml&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now check the pods to verify the installation:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl get pods -n demo&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Create the Quarkus application&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, you'll create a simple Quarkus todo application that will connect to PostgreSQL via Hibernate and Panache. The todo application is a simple rest API for creating, reading, and deleting todo entries in a PostgreSQL database. It is heavily inspired by Clement Escoffier's &lt;a href="https://github.com/cescoffier/quarkus-todo-app"&gt;Quarkus todo app&lt;/a&gt; but focuses less on presentation and more on the binding aspect.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Generate the application using the following Maven command:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;mvn io.quarkus.platform:quarkus-maven-plugin:2.5.0.Final:create -DprojectGroupId=org.acme -DprojectArtifactId=todo-example -DclassName="org.acme.TodoResource" -Dpath="/todo" &lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, add all of the required extensions for connecting to PostgreSQL, generate the required Kubernetes resources, and build a &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/topics/containers"&gt;container&lt;/a&gt; image for the application using Docker:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;./mvnw quarkus:add-extension -Dextensions="resteasy-jackson,jdbc-postgresql,hibernate-orm-panache,kubernetes,kubernetes-service-binding,container-image-docker" &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;At this point, you need to create a simple entity:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-java"&gt;package org.acme; import javax.persistence.Column; import javax.persistence.Entity; import io.quarkus.hibernate.orm.panache.PanacheEntity; @Entity public class Todo extends PanacheEntity { @Column(length = 40, unique = true) public String title; public boolean completed; public Todo() { } public Todo(String title, Boolean completed) { this.title = title; } } &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Then, expose it via REST:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-java"&gt;package org.acme; import javax.transaction.Transactional; import javax.ws.rs.*; import javax.ws.rs.core.Response; import javax.ws.rs.core.Response.Status; import java.util.List; @Path("/todo") public class TodoResource { @GET @Path("/") public List&lt;Todo&gt; getAll() { return Todo.listAll(); } @GET @Path("/{id}") public Todo get(@PathParam("id") Long id) { Todo entity = Todo.findById(id); if (entity == null) { throw new WebApplicationException("Todo with id of " + id + " does not exist.", Status.NOT_FOUND); } return entity; } @POST @Path("/") @Transactional public Response create(Todo item) { item.persist(); return Response.status(Status.CREATED).entity(item).build(); } @GET @Path("/{id}/complete") @Transactional public Response complete(@PathParam("id") Long id) { Todo entity = Todo.findById(id); entity.id = id; entity.completed = true; return Response.ok(entity).build(); } @DELETE @Transactional @Path("/{id}") public Response delete(@PathParam("id") Long id) { Todo entity = Todo.findById(id); if (entity == null) { throw new WebApplicationException("Todo with id of " + id + " does not exist.", Status.NOT_FOUND); } entity.delete(); return Response.noContent().build(); } } &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Bind to the target cluster&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;In order to bind the PostgreSQL service to the application, you must either provide a &lt;code&gt;ServiceBinding&lt;/code&gt; resource or have it generated. To have the binding generated for you, you need to provide the following service coordinates:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;apiVersion&lt;/code&gt;: &lt;code&gt;postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Kind: &lt;code&gt;PostgresCluster&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Name: &lt;code&gt;pg-cluster&lt;/code&gt;, prefixed with &lt;code&gt;quarkus.kubernetes-service-binding.services.&lt;id&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;&lt;p&gt;You can see these coordinates in the following listing:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code&gt;quarkus.kubernetes-service-binding.services.my-db.api-version=postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1 quarkus.kubernetes-service-binding.services.my-db.kind=PostgresCluster quarkus.kubernetes-service-binding.services.my-db.name=pg-cluster &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; is just used to group properties together and can be any text.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You also need to configure the &lt;code&gt;datasource&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code&gt;quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create quarkus.hibernate-orm.sql-load-script=import.sql &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;This sample application will not push the image to a registry, but just loads it to the cluster, so use &lt;code&gt;IfNotPresent&lt;/code&gt; as the image pull policy:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code&gt;quarkus.kubernetes.image-pull-policy=IfNotPresent&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The application properties file should look like this:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code&gt;quarkus.kubernetes-service-binding.services.my-db.api-version=postgres-operator.crunchydata.com/v1beta1 quarkus.kubernetes-service-binding.services.my-db.kind=PostgresCluster quarkus.kubernetes-service-binding.services.my-db.name=pg-cluster quarkus.datasource.db-kind=postgresql quarkus.hibernate-orm.database.generation=drop-and-create quarkus.hibernate-orm.sql-load-script=import.sql quarkus.kubernetes.image-pull-policy=IfNotPresent &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Prepare for deployment&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Before you deploy, you need to perform a container image build, load the image to the cluster, and generate the resource.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;First, build the container image:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;mvn clean install -Dquarkus.container-image.build=true -DskipTests &lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Note that this instruction assumes that you have Docker up and running.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, you'll load the Docker image to the cluster:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kind load docker-image iocanel/todo-example:1.0.0-SNAPSHOT &lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you're using &lt;a href="https://minikube.sigs.k8s.io/docs/start/"&gt;minikube&lt;/a&gt; instead of Docker, execute the following to rebuild the image:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;eval $(minikube docker-env) &lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;When using tools like &lt;code&gt;kind&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;minikube&lt;/code&gt;, it is generally a good idea to change the image pull policy to &lt;code&gt;IfNotPresent&lt;/code&gt; as you did in this example. Doing this avoids unnecessary pulls, because most of the time the image will be loaded from the local Docker daemon.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Deploy the application&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;Next, generate the deployment manifest, including the &lt;code&gt;ServiceBinding&lt;/code&gt;, and apply them on Kubernetes:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;mvn clean install -Dquarkus.kubernetes.deploy=true -DskipTests&lt;/code&gt; &lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Now, verify that everything is up and running:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl get pods -n demo -w&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h2&gt;Verify the installation&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;The simplest way to verify that everything works as expected is to port forward to a local HTTP port and access the &lt;code&gt;/todo&lt;/code&gt; endpoint:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt; &lt;code class="language-bash"&gt;kubectl port-forward service/todo-example 8080:80&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Point your browser to &lt;a href="http://localhost:8080/todo"&gt;http://localhost:8080/todo&lt;/a&gt; and enjoy!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h2&gt;A look ahead&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;p&gt;I am very excited about recent progress on the service binding front. In the near future, we may be able to reduce the amount of configuration necessary with the use of smart conventions (such as assuming that the custom resource name is the same as the database name unless explicitly specified otherwise) and a reasonable set of defaults (such as assuming that for PostgreSQL the default operator is Crunchy Data's Postgres Operator). In such a scenario, you could bind to services with no configuration without sacrificing flexibility or customizability. I hope you are as excited as I am by this prospect!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the following resources to learn more about service binding and the Service Binding Operator:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/10/27/announcing-service-binding-operator-10-ga"&gt;Announcing Service Binding Operator 1.0 GA&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/12/20/service-binding-operator-the-operator-in-action"&gt;Service Binding Operator: The Operator in action&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/11/03/how-use-service-binding-rabbitmq"&gt;How to use service binding with RabbitMQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; The post &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/articles/2021/12/22/how-use-quarkus-service-binding-operator" title="How to use Quarkus with the Service Binding Operator"&gt;How to use Quarkus with the Service Binding Operator&lt;/a&gt; appeared first on &lt;a href="https://developers.redhat.com/blog" title="Red Hat Developer"&gt;Red Hat Developer&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;</summary><dc:creator>Ioannis Kanellos</dc:creator><dc:date>2021-12-22T07:00:00Z</dc:date></entry><entry><title>JBoss Tools 4.21.2.AM1 for Eclipse 2021-09</title><link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="https://tools.jboss.org/blog/4.21.2.am1.html" /><category term="release" /><category term="jbosstools" /><category term="devstudio" /><category term="jbosscentral" /><author><name>jeffmaury</name></author><id>https://tools.jboss.org/blog/4.21.2.am1.html</id><updated>2021-12-30T08:47:35Z</updated><published>2021-12-22T00:00:00Z</published><content type="html">&lt;div&gt;&lt;div id="preamble"&gt; &lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt; &lt;div class="paragraph"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Happy to announce 4.21.2.AM1 (Developer Milestone 1) build for Eclipse 2021-09.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="paragraph"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Downloads available at &lt;a href="https://tools.jboss.org/downloads/jbosstools/2021-09/4.21.2.AM1.html"&gt;JBoss Tools 4.21.2.AM1&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class="sect1"&gt; &lt;h2 id="what-is-new"&gt;&lt;a class="anchor" href="#what-is-new"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;What is New?&lt;/h2&gt; &lt;div class="sectionbody"&gt; &lt;div class="paragraph"&gt; &lt;p&gt;Full info is at &lt;a href="https://tools.jboss.org/documentation/whatsnew/jbosstools/4.21.2.AM1.html"&gt;this page&lt;/a&gt;.
